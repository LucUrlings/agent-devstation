# Repository settings for publication

Create a GitHub ruleset targeting `main`:

1. Require a pull request before merging.
2. Require the `image-and-sdk-smoke` and `arm64-build` CI jobs to pass. Keep required checks tied to the CI workflow in this repository.
3. Require all review conversations to be resolved.
4. Block force pushes and deletion of `main`.
5. If a second trusted maintainer is available, require one approval from someone other than the author. For a solo maintainer, leave the approval count at zero so the maintainer can merge a passing, reviewed PR without a lockout.

Keep the CI workflow read-only for pull requests, including forks. Do not add repository secrets to PR jobs. A trusted push to this repository's protected `main` branch builds and smoke-tests each architecture once, then publishes `nightly` only if both pass. The publishing workflow checks the repository before using its `packages: write` token. Full releases use a separate trusted release workflow. Wait for nightly publishing to finish before creating a release, and point its version tag at that merged commit. Check the GHCR package visibility after the first nightly publish; set it to public if necessary so `docker compose pull` works without a registry login.
