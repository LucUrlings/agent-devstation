# Agent Devstation guide

Start with the [README](../README.md) and copy the complete [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml). The image is prebuilt; no repository clone or local build is needed.

## Image tags and releases

| Tag | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `latest` | Latest full release; Compose default. |
| `v0.1.0` | Example fixed release. |
| `nightly` | Latest successful build from `main`. |
| `nightly-<commit SHA>` | One tested `main` commit. |

Set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_TAG=nightly` in an optional `.env` to use a new merged change before the next release. `pull_policy: always` checks GHCR on every `docker compose up -d`. Release tags promote an already tested `main` image; they do not rebuild it. If an anonymous pull is denied, the GHCR package may need its visibility set to **Public**.

## Compose and projects

The linked [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml) is the complete one-file example. It mounts host `./workspaces` at `/home/dev/workspaces` inside the container and a named volume at `/home/dev` for logins and settings. This puts projects under the phone folder picker's starting home folder. Both agents and the optional editor see the same files and SDKs. `hostname` makes the shell prompt show `dev@agent-devspace`, while `container_name` names the Docker container `agent-devspace`. The Compose service remains `agent-devstation` for `docker compose exec`. A fixed container name allows only one instance with that name per Docker host; change or remove it for another instance. Do not use `docker compose down -v` unless you want to delete the home volume.

`init: true` forwards stop signals and reaps child processes. `stdin_open` and `tty` are unnecessary because `docker compose exec` provides a terminal. On Linux, set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_UID` and `AGENT_DEVSTATION_GID` to the owner of your project files if they differ from `1000:1000`. The image repairs an empty root-owned `./workspaces` bind mount; it will not change a nonempty project's ownership. The container does not mount the Docker socket or use `privileged: true`.

### Docker client tools

Set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_DOCKER_CLI_ENABLED=true` in Compose to install `docker`, `docker compose`, and `docker buildx` at startup. This option defaults to false; add it to existing deployments that previously used the bundled client. The pinned AMD64 or ARM64 downloads are checked against SHA-256 hashes and installed outside the persisted home volume. A normal restart reuses them; a container recreation downloads them again. No Docker daemon runs inside Agent Devstation, and the default Compose file does not configure one.

To use a separately managed DinD sidecar with TLS, add these settings to Agent Devstation's existing service configuration, replacing the service and volume names to match your deployment:

```yaml
environment:
  AGENT_DEVSTATION_DOCKER_CLI_ENABLED: "true"
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://agent-devstation-docker:2376
  DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY: "1"
  DOCKER_CERT_PATH: /certs/client
volumes:
  - agent-devstation-docker-client:/certs/client:ro
```

Merge these entries with the existing environment and mounts. Both services must share a Docker network. The sidecar must generate certificates with `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs`, have a hostname matching the name in `DOCKER_HOST`, and share its `/certs/client` volume with Agent Devstation. Keep the CA private key on the sidecar and do not publish the Docker API port. Wait for the daemon's health check before starting Agent Devstation.

Bind mounts resolve on the daemon: mount the same workspace source at `/home/dev/workspaces` in both containers. Persist the sidecar's `/var/lib/docker` in its own named volume. Project ports published by nested Compose services are reachable from Agent Devstation at the sidecar's hostname; they must bind to the sidecar's network interface, not only its loopback. Publishing those ports again on the outer sidecar is needed only for access through the host.

DinD requires a privileged sidecar, including the official rootless variant. It separates development Docker resources from the main daemon but is not a strong host-security boundary. Do not mount the main host's Docker socket. A dedicated development VM provides stronger isolation. See the [official Docker image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker).

After configuring the connection, run these commands as `dev`:

```sh
docker version
docker compose version
docker buildx version
docker info
```

### Playwright Chromium

Set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_ENABLED=true` and select `AGENT_DEVSTATION_SDK_NODE=24` (or another supported Node release) in Compose. Startup downloads Chromium and its Ubuntu browser dependencies into the disposable container layer. A normal restart reuses the browser; a container recreation downloads it again. Disabling the option removes the browser, while any system dependencies already installed remain until the container is recreated.

The image does not install a global Playwright package or CLI. Each project installs its own Playwright package, and it uses the shared browser through `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/playwright-browsers`. The default browser is for Playwright `1.63.0`; set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION` to the exact version used by the project, then recreate Agent Devstation. Playwright requires a matching browser revision for each package version. [Playwright browser documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).

When the option is disabled, that path points to `/home/dev/.cache/ms-playwright`. Projects can install their own browsers there as `dev`; those downloads persist in the home volume. When enabled, a private installer package stays beside the shared browser to protect it from another project's browser cleanup. Startup checks the installed executable paths and reinstalls if any are missing.

For example, in a project under `/home/dev/workspaces`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test@1.63.0
npx playwright test
```

This browser is available to processes inside Agent Devstation. If a project's tests run inside containers launched by DinD, install the browser in those project containers too; they do not share Agent Devstation's filesystem.

### Simple Codex CLI

Run Codex without host namespace setup:

```sh
docker compose exec -u dev -w /home/dev/workspaces/project agent-devstation codex --no-daemon --sandbox danger-full-access
```

Replace `project` with your project directory. Codex can access all files available to `dev` inside the container, including saved logins. `--no-daemon` means no Codex phone Remote Control. See [OpenAI's permission modes](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sandboxing?surface=cli#how-permissions-work).

### Codex sandboxed setup

For Codex's normal sandbox and phone Remote Control, uncomment `security_opt` in `compose.yaml` and run `docker compose up -d`. Those options disable Docker's seccomp and container AppArmor filters for this service. The image includes `bubblewrap`; check whether your Docker host permits its sandbox:

```sh
docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation codex sandbox -c 'sandbox_mode="read-only"' /bin/sh -lc 'cd "$HOME" && pwd -P'
```

If it prints `/home/dev`, the sandbox prerequisite is ready. Run plain `codex` from a project, or sign in with ChatGPT and follow the [Codex Remote Control steps](#official-phone-remote-control) to start and pair your phone.

### bwrap loopback error

If the sandbox check prints this error on an **Ubuntu 24.04 or 26.04 Docker host**:

```text
bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted
```

First confirm that the full Compose example's `security_opt` lines are enabled and run `docker compose up -d` to recreate the container. Check the sandbox again before changing the host.

On **Ubuntu 26.04**, the `apparmor` package already provides `/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict`. If the sandbox still fails, check and reload that profile **on the Docker host**:

```sh
ls -l /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
```

Do not copy the profile from `/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/` on 26.04; it is not there. [Ubuntu's `apparmor` package file list](https://packages.ubuntu.com/resolute/amd64/apparmor/filelist) shows the installed path.

On **Ubuntu 24.04**, if the profile does not already exist at `/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict`, install, copy, and load it **on the Docker host**:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils
sudo install -m 0644 /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
```

If the profile already exists on 24.04, skip the copy and run only `sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict`. Run the sandbox check again; it should print `/home/dev`. Debian and Fedora may use different host rules. [OpenAI's Linux prerequisites](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sandboxing?surface=cli#prerequisites) explain the host requirements. The image cannot override a host namespace restriction.

To undo these Ubuntu 24.04 profile steps **if that profile file did not exist before you copied it**, remove the loaded profile first, then the file:

```sh
sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
```

`apt update` needs no rollback. Remove `apparmor-profiles` and `apparmor-utils` with `sudo apt remove apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils` only if you installed them solely for this and do not use them elsewhere. Removing the profile can make Codex's sandbox fail again on that host.

## SDK selection

Compose defaults to Python `3.14` and Node.js `24`; .NET, Java, Go, and Rust are off. Set the `AGENT_DEVSTATION_SDK_*` variables in an optional ignored `.env` beside Compose. An empty value turns that SDK off. An unset variable when running the image directly selects none.

Use numbers only: `24` follows the latest Node 24 release, `3.13` follows Python 3.13 patches, and `24.0.1` pins that exact Node release. `.x` is not accepted. Java also supports four-part versions; Rust `1` follows its stable channel. An unavailable version fails startup.

Run `docker compose up -d` after changing a selection. Compose recreates the container, then startup installs the selected SDKs under `/opt/sdk` and removes unselected ones. A normal restart reuses them. Startup logs say what was installed, reused, or removed. SDK commands and variables such as `JAVA_HOME` and `DOTNET_ROOT` work in agent shells and the editor terminal. Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub CLI are included independently of SDK choices.

## Authentication

**Codex with ChatGPT:** `docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation codex login --device-auth`. Enable device-code login in ChatGPT settings if needed. For API-key login, export `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the host and pipe it without saving it in Compose:

```sh
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | docker compose exec -T -u dev agent-devstation codex login --with-api-key
```

Codex stores login state in the home volume. API-key login does not provide a ChatGPT identity for phone pairing. [OpenAI authentication](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth).

**Claude Code:** run `docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation claude auth login` for a subscription account. For API-key use, export `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on the host and run `docker compose exec -u dev -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY agent-devstation claude`. [Claude authentication](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication).

**GitHub CLI:** run `docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation gh auth login`. Its token may be saved as plain text under `/home/dev/.config/gh`; use a temporary `GH_TOKEN` instead if preferred. [GitHub CLI authentication](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login).

Keep keys and login files out of the image, repository, and `.env`. Anyone with access to the home volume or editor terminal can read them.

## Official phone Remote Control

Neither agent needs a public agent port. Both workflows use outbound connections.

**Codex:** complete the [sandboxed setup](#codex-sandboxed-setup), sign in with ChatGPT, then run:

```sh
docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation codex remote-control start
docker compose exec -u dev agent-devstation codex remote-control pair
```

[OpenAI documents these CLI commands](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands) but marks them experimental. Its [general phone setup guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/remote-connections) still describes pairing through the desktop app, so headless pairing is not guaranteed. If your phone offers manual code entry, use the short-lived code while signed in to the same ChatGPT account. An API key alone cannot pair a phone. Do not expose a Codex app-server port.

After a successful `start`, the home volume remembers the choice and resumes Remote Control after restart or recreation. `codex remote-control stop` or `codex logout` turns off automatic resumption. A recreated container downloads Codex's separate daemon package again. The phone folder picker starts at `/home/dev` and should show `workspaces` there; if it cannot find the home folder, repeat the [sandbox probe](#codex-sandboxed-setup). Pairing and the phone UI require a manual account test.

**Claude Code:** from a project, run `docker compose exec -u dev -w /home/dev/workspaces/project agent-devstation claude remote-control`, then open its URL or scan its QR code. Claude requires an eligible Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise subscription login; an API key alone does not enable Remote Control. Organization policy and project trust can also block it. Re-run the command after a container restart. [Claude Remote Control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control).

## Browser editor

Set `AGENT_DEVSTATION_VSCODE_EDITOR_ENABLED=true` and a strong `AGENT_DEVSTATION_VSCODE_PASSWORD` in `.env`, then run `docker compose up -d`. The image downloads code-server on first use; turning the editor off and recreating removes it. Its login page is separate from agent accounts. It opens `/home/dev/workspaces` and its terminal has the selected SDKs.

Container port **8080** serves only the editor. For local access, uncomment the loopback port mapping in Compose. For remote access, configure your reverse proxy to reach `agent-devstation:8080` on a shared network, with TLS, proxy authentication, and WebSocket support. Keep code-server's own password enabled. Do not expose an agent protocol port or mount the Docker socket.

## Updates, troubleshooting, and security

Run `docker compose up -d` to pull the selected tag. A new image or changed environment recreates the container and reinstalls selected SDKs and editor. `docker compose restart` keeps the existing container and does not apply changed SDK selections. Back up both `workspaces/` and the named home volume; `docker compose down -v` deletes the volume.

If startup fails, check `docker compose logs agent-devstation` for version, download, or workspace ownership errors. For a Codex daemon socket error, inspect `/home/dev/.codex/app-server-daemon/daemon.stderr.log` inside the container; the socket message alone does not identify the cause. If you upgraded from the old `devstation` service name, run `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`.

The editor and agents can read mounted projects and home credentials and reach the network. Use trusted projects, keep the editor authenticated, and never mount the Docker socket. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting.
